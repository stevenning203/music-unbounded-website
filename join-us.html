						<hr>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The safety of you and students is the priority. If you are doing in person lessons, and wearing a mask is possible, please do so. 
							</li>
							<li>
								No swearing or cursing in the lessons.  Usage of offensive language of any kind, including discriminatory phrases, is prohibited.
							</li>
							<li>
								The studentâ€™s musical interests take priority over the interests of the teacher regarding the songs being learned and the style of music that the student wishes to learn.
							</li>
							<li>
								Recording or taking pictures of a student without the permission of their legal guardians is prohibited 
							</li>
							<li>
								Teachers should approach lessons with a positive attitude as they are reflecting the integrity of the organization.
							</li>
							<li>
								Disciplinary measures should be avoided.  This includes yelling and the use of punishments.  When possible, the parent should be contacted in the event that disciplinary action may be required.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you suspect your student is being abused or mistreated by their guardians, you must report this to an executive member.
