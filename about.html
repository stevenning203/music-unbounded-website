							We all know that music can be expensive; however, there have been many positive impacts that have been observed with children who begin to learn music at an early age.
							These range from brain growth and increased academic success all the way to better memory, attention, and coordination.
							This is why we have decided to create the non-profit organization Music Unbounded, where we take people who have a passion for music as volunteers to teach their respective instruments for free.
							We aim to introduce grade K-9 children to music, brightening their future and maybe even allowing them to discover a life-long passion in the process.

							What We Do
						</div>
						<br>
						<div id = "mission_blurb">
							We provide free music lessons targeting youth in elementary and junior high who may
							not have the opportunity to take private music lessons.
							The lessons are 45 minutes long and will occur biweekly at a minimum.
							These lessons will be provided for up to 5 months, or half of a school year.
							Lesson times will be organized between teacher and student.
							We are currently in the process of having the cost of instrument rentals subsidized either through government grants or local music shops.
